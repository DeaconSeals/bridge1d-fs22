    "## Fitness Function\n",
    "This semester we'll be exploring multiple problem domains where it may be appropriate to apply evolutionary computing. There will be two assignment series in which you will autonomously design bridges and evolve agents to play a simplified version of Ms. Pac-Man, respectively. In assignment series 1 (what you're doing now), your goal is to search for bridge designs that satisfy problem constraints in a physics simulation. To make this assignment more about your ability to understand and implement search algorithms, we're providing you with an implementation of the physics simulation and problem instances. The files `bridge_fitness.py` and `frame.py` implement the problem, and you are free to treat them as a black box. You won't have to understand or modify the code in those files, though you do need to understand the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will interact with this implementation by using a function `basic_simulation()` that takes as input a list of (x, y) coordinate pairs along with an assortment of problem-instance parameters. The list of (x, y) pairs you provide corresponds to joints within your bridge that are automatically connected to one another based on proximity. So, if the instance-specific parameter for this proximity is set to 3 m, then any points within 3 m of one another will be connected with a beam of some specific material and construction (e.g., a solid carbon fiber beam with a square cross-section). The problem instance also provides anchor points on the ground as points within a connected roadbed. Within the simulation, weight is increasingly applied and the bridge is scored by the weight at which it fails. This means that a stronger bridge will receive a higher score. The mechanics of this problem are not unlike those in the [Bridge Constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_Constructor) game franchise or [World of Goo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Goo).\n",
    "\n",
    "The other important function we provide is `plot_bridge()`, which visualizes the relative forces acting on a bridge. The following cell will evaluate a hand-designed bridge and produce a score as described above, to show how these two functions work:"

    "## Random Initialization\n",
    "Note that the representation of the bridge accepted by the simulation function is a little peculiar. In EA terms we call this a fixed-length string (not to be confused with a character string) and it's a classical representation EAs work well with. This is synomymous with a fixed-length linear genotype. Fixed-length refers to the fact that there are a predefined number of loci (locations for genes), and linear simply means it is a 1-dimensional vector. We've provided a partially-complete class (`LinearGenotype`) for this representation. \n",
    "\n",
    "For your first task, implement the `random_initialization()` method of this class (found in the `linear_genotype.py` file) to get the following cell to work. This function accepts inputs for list length, x bounds, and y bounds and should uniform randomly create a list of (x, y) tuples that adhere to the provided bounds and the specified length of the list. This function should store this list in the `gene` member variable of the calling object (`self`). Note that these coordinates must be generated as floating-point (real) values, NOT integers. *You can ignore the other methods of the `LinearGenotype` class until Assignment 1b.*"

    "**IMPORTANT**: Before continuing, read the instructions here very carefully. You will need to change your function to record more data! You don't want to start your searches, wait several hours for them to finish, then find out you didn't actually record everything you need!\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the code you wrote above, restart and run a random search with 5,000 evaluations 30 times (this can take several hours of computation). For each of the 30 runs, record the highest fitness encountered during the run. This data will be used later for statistical analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the bridge with the highest fitness across all runs, plot the bridge within this cell. Example code for visualizing can be found earlier in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the run that produced the highest fitness of all 30 runs, record data to produce a stairstep plot demonstrating the progress of this run as the search was performed. For reference, the stairstep plot should look something like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "To reiterate, you will need:\n",
    "* The highest fitness encountered in each run\n",
    "    * 30 numbers, 1 per run\n",
    "* The output of `plot_bridge()` of the best bridge in the experiment\n",
    "* Data for generating the stairstep plot\n",
    "    * Generated from the run that produced your best bridge\n",
    "        * HINT: You can NOT determine which run that should be before recording this data -- the run would already be finished!\n",
    "    * What this data should be, and how to record it, is left for you to decide. We will accept anything that can produce a complete & correct plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is up to you to determine how to record and store the necessary data. You are also welcome to generate the stairstep graph using whatever software you like, though we recommend using `matplotlib`. Excel also works, but it gets very tedious using it for every dataset for every assignment."
